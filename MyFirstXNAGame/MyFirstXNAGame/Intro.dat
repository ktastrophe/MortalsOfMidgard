In the palms of the god

Who crashed through the boughs

of the Tree of Life,

There came to be lodged

The splinters of a million million realms...


And in each such sliver

That thought itself the whole,

Mortal lives played out as before,

Weaving unto each world

A design unlike the last...


Into one of these realms,

Might there be borne a seed

That could sprout the Tree of Life anew?


And, should such a seed be found,

Will it be 'what', or...
