Plight of the Valkyries

For reasons unknown, the Valkyries have been exiled from Valhalla to the mortal realms,
and confined to strange dwellings that nullify their senses. After eons of such
blindness, these reapers have all but forgotten their life's work: to
hie fallen Norsemen to their rightful place in the afterlife. 

Find a manner to remind a Valkyrie of her purpose, thereby freeing her.
 (Have a human soul inhabit a gem of soul trapping)
(Bring soul to the sealed room of the catacombs where a valkyrie is held captive)

Gems of Soul Trapping, in the rough, are only able to contain the soul for so many
turns before their power is exhausted, leaving them an inert dull gem.
Souls will have to be transferred from one gem to another, unless the player
(or friendly NPC) creates a setting for it with blacksmithing skill.
Enter Ring of Soul Trapping!!!

A set number of gems can be mined from a Soul Geode with the pickaxe.
