| Plight of the Valkyries

For reasons unknown, the Valkyries have been exiled from Valhalla to the mortal realms
and confined to strange dwellings that nullify their senses. After eons of such
blindness, these reapers have all but forgotten their life's work: to
hie fallen Norsemen to their rightful place in the afterlife.
