Unstarted Tasks:
-----------------------------
1. Game Over Screen

In-game
-------
1. Have the player start in a camp (graphic with a fire pit, maybe discarded food, etc.)
Have the starting inventory NOT be automatically assigned, but be there to pick up, take it or leave it.
Player may only take so many items before the remaining goods get magically spirited away.

2. Implement a real-time day-to-night system? Could have different monsters during daytime vs nighttime

on your hands, wearing gloves makes you blind, etc.
