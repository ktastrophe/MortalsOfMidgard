# MortalsOfMidgard
A roguelike RPG based on the DOS game, Ragnarok. (XNA 3.0 Game Project)

Mortals of Midgard is a roguelike RPG project that I was working on from 2012 to 2014, when it became obvious that it was more than I could handle by myself. That's where you come in (hopefully)!

It was coded in Visual Studio C# 2008 (a.k.a. vs9), in XNA 3.0. Please open the solution file, MortalsOfMidgard.sln, in Visual Studio, to load the proper files and assets.

Please see the additional file, MoM Readme.rtf, for instructions on how to play the game.
