# MortalsOfMidgard
A roguelike RPG based on the DOS game, Ragnarok. (XNA 3.0 Game Project)

Mortals of Midgard is a roguelike RPG project that I was working on from 2012 to 2014, when it became obvious that it was more than I could handle by myself. That's where you come in (hopefully)!

It was coded in Visual Studio 2008, in XNA 3.0. Please open the solution file, MortalsOfMidgard.sln, in Visual Studio, to load the proper files and assets.

I'll add a more permissive license, if / when someone has expressed interest in working on this project with me. Thanks for looking!
